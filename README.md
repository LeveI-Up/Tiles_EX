# Tiles_EX
In this homework i took the original game from Erel github and change it to make it a result for the tasks.

For task D:
I added a diamond tile to the tile pallete.
I took the scene: 4-generation -> d-tilemap-100-player and changed the code of Scripts->4-generation->TilemapCaveGenerator.
If the tile that chosen is a floor i draw a number between 0-100 and if its under 2 the selected tile will be a Diamond tile.

For Task E:
I took the scene: 4-generation -> d-tilemap-100-player and changed the code of Scripts->2-player->KeyboardMoverByTile.
I added to the code an option to dig in the walls, the player should hold the 'X' botton and move toward the wall for digging.

For task J:
I choose the game ZULU from www.myabandonware.com and i created a tile map that look like one level of the game. 
I took the scene: 2-player -> b-tile-movement, I added to the tile pallete grass tile and different floor.
I draw tile map as one level from the original game and add a player with the c# code component of KeyboardMoverByTile for moving in the maze.
